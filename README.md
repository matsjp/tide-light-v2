# Tidelight Project  

During my studies, I started a tide light hobby project, which has grown over time, and I have even made some money from it. The tide light is an Internet of Things (IoT) project consisting of a Raspberry Pi and an LED strip that lights up to indicate whether the tide is rising or falling and how far along the tidal cycle the water is.  

It is programmed in Python and runs on a Raspberry Pi. To determine the tide status, it fetches data from the Norwegian Mapping Authority's tide API. The tide light features a Bluetooth configuration interface, and I have built a website that uses Web Bluetooth to configure the tide location, adjust brightness, and connect the Pi to WiFi.  

This project has been commercialized, and I have delivered lights to several customers. One of these customers is Thon Hotel Svolv√¶r, for which I delivered a 10-meter-long tide light.  



# Config file

```
[apivalues]
lat=59.908559
lon=10.73451
```

```lat```: the latitude where you want tide data from.

```lon```: the longitude where you want tide data from.

The combination of lat and lon must be a geographic area where the Kartverket tide api can get data from.

```
[ledstrip]
LED_COUNT=60
LED_PIN=18
LED_FREQ_HZ=800000
LED_DMA=10
LED_BRIGHTNESS=50
LED_INVERT=False
LED_CHANNEL=0
```

```LED_COUNT```: the amount of addressable LEDs on the strip

```LED_PIN```: the GPIO pin connected to the LED strip

```LED_FREQ_HZ```: don't touch, leave at ```800000```

```LED_DMA```: don't touch, leave at ```10```

```LED_BRIGHTNESS```: the brightness of the LEDs. Must be a number between ```0``` and ```255```

```LED_INVERT```: don't touch, leave at ```False```

```LED_CHANNEL```: don't touch, leave at ```0```

```
[ldr]
ldr_pin=11
ldr_active=False
```

```ldr_pin```: the GPIO pin connected to the ldr
```ldr_active```: if the light auto dim should be active or not. ```True``` to make it active, ```False``` to make it inactive

```
[color]
color_format=rgb
high_tide_direction_color=[0,255,0]
low_tide_direction_color=[255,0,0]
tide_level_indicator_color=[0,0,255]
no_tide_level_indicator_color=[128,0,128]
tide_level_indicator_moving_color=[[255,73,115],[255,159,176],[100,100,255]]
no_tide_level_indicator_moving_color=[[91,73,255],[73,164,255],[73,255,255]]
moving_pattern=wave
moving_speed=0.5
```

```color_format```: the color format used by the LED strip. Can be rgb or bgr

```high_tide_direction_color```: the color of the top LED when water is moving towards high tide. Color is RGB or BGR depending on ```color_format``` and must follow this format ```[N,N,N]``` where ```N``` is a number between ```0``` and ```255```

```low_tide_direction_color```: the color of the bottom LED when the water is moving towards low tide. Color is RGB or BGR depending on ```color_format``` and must follow this format ```[N,N,N]``` where ```N``` is a number between ```0``` and ```255```

```tide_level_indicator_color```: the color of the LEDs showing where the tide currently is. These are the bottom LEDs. Color is RGB or BGR depending on ```color_format``` and must follow this format ```[N,N,N]``` where ```N``` is a number between ```0``` and ```255```

```no_tide_level_indicator_color```: the color of the LEDs showing where the tide currently isn't. These are the top LEDs. Color is RGB or BGR depending on ```color_format``` and must follow this format ```[N,N,N]``` where ```N``` is a number between ```0``` and ```255```

```tide_level_indicator_moving_color```: the color of the LEDS moving accross the LEDs indicating where the tide currently is.

```no_tide_level_indicator_moving_color```: the color of the LEDS moving accross the LEDs indicating where the tide currently isn't.

```tide_level_indicator_moving_color``` and ```no_tide_level_indicator_moving_color``` colors are RGB or BGR depending on ```color_format```. Both need to follow the following format ```[[N,N,N],[N,N,N],[N,N,N]]``` where N is a number between ```0``` and ```255```. ```[N,N,N]``` is the RGB value of a single LED. The number of LEDs in ```tide_level_indicator_moving_color``` and ```no_tide_level_moving_color``` must be equal

```moving_pattern```: the pattern of the moving colors. ```wave```: makes the LEDs move across like a wave

```moving_speed```: the moving speed of the LEDs. The number is amount of seconds between each LED movement
